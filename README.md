```
A sophisticated signal processing programs that implements real-time DSP algorithms for rPPG signal and respiration signal analysis. Our project focuses on delivering acurate signal processing capabilities within this program.

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Implement advanced DSP algorithms for audio processing
- Provide real-time rPPG and respiration signal visualization and analysis
- Develop efficient filter implementations

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### System Requirements
- Python 3.10.11
- Windows OS
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- 800MB free disk space

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IF3024-Final-Project.git
cd IF3024-Final-Project
```

2. (Optional)Create virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. (Optional)Activate environment:
```bash
./venv/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. You're all set, you can run the program now :D.

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Operations
1. Launch the application, you can choose to run it from main to run both module or running one module at a time:
```bash
python main.py
python respiration_module.py
python rppg_module.py
```

2. To stop the running program, you can press the 'Q' key on the keyboard.
   
3. After stopping the program, matplotlib window will shows up and show signal captured as the program running. You have the option to save the result.

## Disclaimer
The main.py file has not yet been optimized, so the program may run sluggish and slow. For better reading it suggested to run each module individually.

## üîç Troubleshooting
- Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Check Python version compatibility
- Monitor system resource usage
